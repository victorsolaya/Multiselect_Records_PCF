# Multiselect Records

## Description

This control has been created to select many records from an entity.
What this will do is to insert the data split by the delimiter you have selected in your control in the single text field this is attached.
This can be useful to retrieve a "list of records" from a single field and it can be used in a plugin.

## How to configure

1. Add the control to the field that will contain the data split by your delimiter.
2. The parameters of the control are explained below

## Parameters

1. Field -> It is the field that will contain the data
2. Entity Name -> Records from this entity name will be displayed
3. Filter -> Filter to reduce the amount of data that will be displayed in your list. This is explained in the next section.
4. Field Filter Values -> This will behave dynamically for the filter. They ARE REQUIRED to be split by comma (,) This is explained in the next section.
5. Data -> Which field from the entity name selected (2) you want to be set in the field (1)
6. Columns -> To retrieve and display the data you need to set the columns with the following syntax: Display Name, fieldName; Account Name,name
7. Header Visible -> Set if the header will be visible in the list displayed.
8. Delimiter for the exposed data -> This will be the delimiter to split the data in your field (1)
9. Is Multiple -> If true you can select all the records you want, if false, only one record can be selected. (True = Multiple | False = Single)
10. Populated Field Visible -> Set if the field that gets populated will be visible.

## Filter section

This is a quite important section because this will allow us to not retrieve all the data from an entity.
How it is set is to take a fetchxml or a WebApi query as ?$filter= ...

This has been implemented with parameters. All of our parameters will be set with the following syntax: {1}

- {0} will be ALWAYS the search box input.
This means that if you set in your filter: ?$filter=contains(name,'{0}') every time you input some text you will be querying against the webapi
This can be used as well in the fetchxml.

      THIS IS QUITE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT ARE GOING TO APPEAR. THE LIST WILL BE SHOWN ONLY WHEN 50 ITEMS ARE RETRIEVED

- {1} {2} are the parameters you set in your Field Filter Values.
This means that if you need to filter your query based on a field in the entity this control is set, you have to add that field in your query.
The Field Filter Values is a Xrm.Webapi call to the record as we have the entityid and the entityname.

      THESE ARE OPTIONAL, THEY ARE REPRESENTED BY {1}, {2}, THERE IS NO LIMIT, BUT WILL ALWAYS BE REFERENCE TO THE ENTITY YOU ARE RIGHT NOW

#### Notes

Just for your knowledge, the $filter=contains WILL NOT work in the offline mode, this is based on a limitation not written in the API.
There is already an issue open with Microsoft about this. [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/dynamics-365-customer-engagement/issues/1916](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/dynamics-365-customer-engagement/issues/1916)

### Example

This control is set in the account entity.
We have a control in a single text field that is retrieving contacts.
We want to retrieve the contacts which full name contains our input and the parentcustomerid is the id of the record we are right now.

For that we will put the following parameters:
- Filter -> ?$filter=contains(fullname, '{0}') and _parentcustomerid_value eq {1}
- Field Filter Values -> accountid

This will filter our contacts with the account we are right now and it will be filtered more when we search in our box.

### Example with two parameters

- Filter -> ?$filter=contains(fullname, '{0}') and _parentcustomerid_value eq {1} and contactcountry eq {2}
- Field Filter Values -> accountid,country

This will filter our contacts with the account we are right now and its country plus it will be filtered more when we search in our box.

## Bugs known from PCF

When you are trying to copy and paste a complete FetchXml probably you are limited to 100 characters. That is because a known bug, but here is the answer to this problem:
[Characters problems](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Power-Apps-Pro-Dev-ISV/Problem-with-maximum-length-of-Input-parameters-which-are-of/m-p/289788/highlight/true#M231)

To sum up, go to your dev tools and change the max length of that field from 100 to 4000 (That is the maximum allowed for a TextArea parameter).
